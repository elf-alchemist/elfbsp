Section 01: Project goals
=========================

VigilantBSP intends to fulfill several ambitious goals:

1. Fast build times for maps without sacrificing support for 
special effects like self-referencing sectors. Use parallelism
where possible to achieve faster builds on multi-core computers.
2. Support for Heretic and Hexen games being as robust as support
for Doom / Doom 2.
3. Features that help get maps within vanilla limits are researched
and implemented, without getting in the way of support for maps 
targeting advanced engines (Boom, etc.)
4. Make self-referencing sector effects easy to use for mappers,
preferably without need for mappers to mark them manually.
Default settings should already support self-referencing sector
effects very well. Monsters in self-referencing sectors shall
be able to see, hear and attack the player.
5. Special effects provided by other nodebuilders (horizon effect
and "precious" linedefs from BSP v5.2, faster scrollers from 
ZokumBSP) are also getting implemented.

In future, support for GL nodes / UDMF format MAY be considered
as well. 

Partial support for RMB effects is already implemented since
version 0.74a. Eventually, most RMB effects are going to be
supported.

Section 02: Basic usage
=======================

VigilantBSP is a console, rather than GUI, program. If you want
to run it manually (and in some cases you really have to!), rather
than from map editor such as GzdoomBuilder, you need to run it 
from a terminal (GNU/Linux) or the command shell (cmd.exe in Win32). 

NOTE: Applying RMB effects will likely require you to run VigilantBSP
manually indeed.

The command-line looks like the following:
vigilantbsp {-options} filename.wad {-o output.wad}

where
1. Options is an optional list of options as seen below
2. Filename.wad is a single input wad file name and is required.
Use quotes "" to specify filename if it contains spaces
3. Output.wad is an optional output wad file name

To launch VigilantBSP on a file called "filename.wad" with 
default options, type:
	vigilantbsp filename.wad
As the result of execution, filename.wad will be read and 
then updated. 

If you rather not overwrite input wad, you type:
	vigilantbsp input.wad -o output.wad
	
Note: when you don't specify an output file, a temporary file
is created, then deleted when the execution ends.

Important node about options. Although they do resemble POSIX
syntax (for those who know what it is), they are rather modelled
after the options format as used by another nodebuilder ZokumBSP.
For example, choosing 8,8 offset for blockmap is done by entering
the following line:
	vigilantbsp -bo=1 input.wad
 
Complete list of options follows, where tabs means that this option
is either a suboption of option above it, or a possible value:

	f= Tuning factor (seg split cost, etc.)
		17 - default seg split cost
	d= Penalty factor for _diagonal_ lines
		34 - default for Hexen format levels, for others 0 (disabled)
		Explicitly specifying non-zero value will enable it for all levels,
		while explicitly specifying 0 will disable it even for Hexen levels		

-r Rebuild REJECT resource.
	z Insert zero-filled REJECT resource
	g Use graphs to reduce LOS calculations (default: enabled)
	s= If 2-sided lines have same sector on both sides
		0 Mark such sectors as always visible (default)
		1 Mark visible only when self-referencing sector effects are detected
		2 Be pedantic about self-referencing sector visibility
	m Process RMB option file (.rej)
		
-m (example -m:map01+map03) Rebuild only specific maps
		
-v Add verbosity to text output. Use multiple times for increased verbosity.

These options are going to be covered in further sections.

Section 03: Features
====================

03:01 Parallelism
-----------------

One of innovative features of VigilantBSP is parallelism: nodes, blockmap
and reject are built in parallel to each other, rather than sequentially.
Though this parallelism is per level, the overall build time can be
(sometimes significantly) less than with hitherto dominant
'sequential execution' design for such programs.

VigilantBSP also - like another popular nodebuilder called ZokumBSP -
supports the ability to build multiple BLOCKMAPs, each with different
offsets, and write the smallest one to wad file. This process can be
(and is, by default) also parallelized.

03:02 Self-referencing sector support
-------------------------------------

VigilantBSP takes care not to destroy self-referencing sector effects
or cause issues (such as monsters not seeing or attacking the player) 
when mapper is using self-referencing sectors with either default or
non-default options. 

For example, in a wad built by Zennode, monsters would not be able 
to attack the player from self-referencing sector unless the wad
was built with zero-filled REJECT lump. In a wad built by VigilantBSP,
monsters will correctly be able to attack the player when they have 
a line of sight, even when REJECT is conventionally built. Also, 
both Zennode and VigilantBSP have option to not create segs from
some "invisible" linedefs - in VigilantBSP, this option will not
cause self-referencing sectors to be destroyed in-game.

In order to identify self-referencing sectors automatically for things
such as "not skipping seg creation in error" or "not hiding this sector
in error", there is a need to be able to tell the outer perimeter of the 
sector. A blueprint for finding a perimeter is available, although not 
without limitations: it may fail in case of overlapping/intersecting lines,
report bogus self-referencing sectors because of nested perimeters 
found within the same sectors, or some other fairly complicated
configurations. However, most of computations requiring this algorithm
are optional, or not expected to present a detrimental effect on overall
results even in case of failure.

Support for RMB options file (*.rej) also places demand to identify
self-referencing secgtors and their surroundings rather robustly,
to make sure RMB effects that depend on distance between sectors 
to be applied correctly.

03:03 Tackling vanilla and port limits
--------------------------------------

VigilantBSP implements several features to help produce more complex
maps under vanilla limits than hitherto possible. Some of these features
are opt-in, disabled by default because they can cause problem with
some versions of advanced source ports, or because they can increase
build-time significantly. It also has features for advanced ports,
such as support of DeepBSP ("standard V4") nodes format, "maelstrom"
 - very fast but not visplane- or seg-savvy mode which builds nodes
 real fast and can enable frustration-free editing of big complex maps.
 
VigilantBSP uses several techniques (some are built-in, others are
opt-in or opt-out) to increase the chance that blockmaps will work
under either vanilla or limit-removing port, when blockmap is closer
to limit. 

03:04 Continuing research on reducing visplanes
--------------------------------------

VigilantBSP reimplements both the Lee Killough's partition selection 
algorithm (as implemented in BSP v5.2) and a new variation of it that
intends to lower the number of simultaneously visible visplanes and so 
reduce the chance of VPO in vanilla engine. The second algorithm is
implemented in VigilantBSP for the first time. It was inspired by 
obvious inaccuracies in the first algorithm, as well as notes by 
Lee Killough on what he thought could be useful, but was/seemed hard 
to do at the time. 

It is intended that this new algorithm be updated from version to 
version of VigilantBSP to improve accuracy and incorporate new research
on reducing visplanes.

03:05 Sharing lump space for REJECT lumps filled with zeroes
------------------------------------------------------------

Computing a proper REJECT lump is often the slowest process. VigilantBSP
can be instructed to create zero-filled REJECT lumps instead. If done so,
these REJECT lumps will be written so that they overlap between each other
and possibly even contiguous block of zeroes in some other wad data, which
decreases wad size.

This technique has no detrimental effect on either vanilla engine or advanced
ports. However, because some editors - such as SLADE3 - have (or had, at the 
time of this writing) misguided algorithm to disable loading overlapping lumps 
if they start on the same offset (which "defense measure against troll wads" 
had also impact on some other legitimate tools, such as the one to shrink wad
size), VigilantBSP uses a countermeasure to bypass this detection by making 
zero-filled REJECT lumps still overlap, but start on different offsets. The
offsets are picked so that the savings are maximized.

03:06 Polyobject awareness
--------------------------

In Hexen wad format, polyobjects can be constructed, and they require special
care. I ported some relevant code from AJ-BSP into VigilantBSP, and intend to
do more (testers needed, and possibly people in the know).

In VigilantBSP v0.75a, a number of adjustments were made to partitioners that
may increase BSP tree size for Hexen maps but nonetheless will prevent more
sectors with polyobjects from getting split into multiple subsectors 
instead of one. For example, one of polyobjects in map05 of Hexen, Guardian
of Steel, used to get broken when hexen.wad was rebuilt using seg balancing,
default partitioner, BEFORE the adjustments were made. Even visplane-aware
partitioners used to split that sector into 2 subsectors, but the update now
causes entire sector in question in that map to be covered with 1 subsector
(finally!), which is preferable for sectors involved in polyobjects.

03:07 Linguortal support
------------------------

Linguortal support is still under development and has lots of bugs and
limitations. This unofficial release of development version of 0.75a allows
some people to experiment with it nonetheless.

The currently "supported" version doesn't move segs but instead tries to
reuse node built for off-map linguortal destination in another place,
which might or might not come with acceptable limitations.

To use linguortal effect in your own map - assuming you are using
the appropriate version of VigilantBSP - you need to make an "island" 
(surrounded by void only and not inside some other geometry) OFF MAP.
Then, to view that island, you need to tag one of linedefs belonging to
it with an unique tag (but not put a special), then you put the same
tag AND special number 1097 on linedef from whose back you want to see
that destination you drew earlier off map.

You will likely need to experiment with building the same map with different
partition algorithms so that one of them would provide somewhat acceptable
results, as the research on implementation is still ongoing.

Section 04: Custom linedef specials and tags
============================================

This entire section applies only to Doom/Doom 2 and Heretic maps, but not 
to maps for Hexen or in Hexen format. Most numbers mentioned here simply
cannot be specified in Hexen format because the size of tag (arg 1) and action
is only 1 byte (unsigned 1 byte would allow only integers in range 0..255).
All action numbers have different meanings in Hexen as well.

Certain linedef specials and tag numbers have special meaning in VigilantBSP.
Most of these were appropriated from another nodebuilder, ZokumBSP. 
Additionally, horizon effect and setting linedef to be precious (protected
from splits when creating segs and nodes) from BSP v5.2 are supported.

Action (linedef special type) with special meanings:
48      Exactly like regular Doom (or Heretic), except tag decides scroll speed.
1048    Remote scroll nearest wall with same tag. Scroll speed is defined
		by two last digits of the tag.
1078    Not yet supported (ZokumBSP implements this, we do not - yet)
1079    Not yet supported (ZokumBSP implements this, we do not - yet)
1080    Rotate the rendered wall N degrees, where degrees is taken from tag.**
1081    Set the wall rotation to a hardcoded degree, degree taken from tag.**
1082    Rotate the rendered wall N BAMs, BAMs taken from tag.**
1083    Set the wall rotation to a hardcoded BAM, taken from tag.**
1084    Do not render seg on the second side of a linedef.
1085    Do not render seg on the front side of a linedef.
1086    Do not render segs on any side of a linedef.

Linedef tags with special meanings:
>=900*	Precious linedef: avoid splitting seg when building nodes
998   	Do not render this linedef.
999   	Do not add this linedef to the blockmap. Additionally, if line is 
        one-sided, rotate the rendered wall N degrees, where degrees
        is taken from tag.**
* excluding 998 and 999
** This can be used to produce horizon and infinite ocean effect when angle
in degrees = 180, see 
https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/94604-horizon-effect-in-vanilla-only/
(credit: Bzzrak). However, historically, most limit-removing and advanced
ports wouldn't display this effect correctly, if they chose to override angle
with a more precise computation required for wall wiggle fix (TODO add link)
UNCONDITIONALLY. Preventing wall wiggle does NOT have to break this effect, 
but historically used implementations did, and most versions of such popular 
ports as  Crispy-Doom and PrBoom-Plus WERE affected by this. This is beginning
to change as developers are now made aware of this effect, and so explicitly
reenable its support even while wall wiggle fix is implemented. Newest versions
of Crispy-Doom will render this effect correctly and still fix wall wiggle,
whereas newest version of Sprinkled Doom will support this effect without 
implementing wall wiggle fix as the latter not compatible with the goals of that
project. Ports such as Chocolate Doom and CnDoom (as well as outdated versions 
of Sprinkled Doom when it was more of limit-raising rather than limit-removing port) 
always supported this effect.

Linedef tags >=900 and the rotation part for tag 999 effect originate from BSP
nodebuilder. 

04:01 Seg manipulation specials
-------------------------------

This feature, as well as documentation for it, originated in ZokumBSP 
version 1.0.10+ and is reimplemented in VigilantBSP as well.

"
The following four additional linedef specials allow you to change the angle
of the rendered wall. This can be useful for special effects like subtly
changed secret doors.

BAM (Binary Angle Measurement) is the internal degree system used in the Doom 
engine games. They use 16 bits to differentiate up to 65536 different angles.

There is support for both BAMs and the more familiar 360 degree system. The
tag tells the node builder how many degrees clockwise the wall should be
rotated.

Numeric Effect
1080    Rotate the rendered wall N degrees, where degrees is taken from tag.
1081    Set the wall rotation to a hardcoded degree, degree taken from tag.
1082    Rotate the rendered wall N BAMs, BAMs taken from tag.
1083    Set the wall rotation to a hardcoded BAM, taken from tag.

1084    Do not render seg on the second side of a linedef.
1085    Do not render seg on the front side of a lindedef.
1086    Do not render segs on any side of a linedef.
"

04:02 Scrolling wall specials / changes
---------------------------------------

This feature, as well as documentation for it, also originated in
ZokumBSP version 1.0.10+ and is reimplemented in VigilantBSP as well.

Technical details: to implement this effect, nodebuilder has to create
a number of dummy _linedefs_ with action '48'. Most, if not all, current
editors will show these linedefs after map is reloaded (they are 
completely overlapping the linedef onto which 'the effect' is applied on, 
so if you select that linedef with a range selection tool, you will see you
selected multiple linedefs). These linedefs may be inadvertently destroyed 
when dragging geometry.

Note: the dummy linedef count is matched to effect strength (specified by
tag) only when both blockmap AND nodes are getting rebuilt (by default they
do, but user can suppress this). This is because both structures use 
linedef indices which may become invalid when those dummy linedefs are 
deleted.

There is a maximum limit (in vanilla at least) of 64 scrolling walls in
a map. Speeding it up to 3x uses three times as many of the 64 maximum 
entries.

'48' Scrolling wall, in addition tag sets speed.

In addition to the normal behaviour of a scrolling wall, one can now adjust
the scrool speed by setting the tag of the wall. Setting it to two will make
it scroll twice as fast as a normal scroller, 3x 3 times as fast etc.

'1048' Remote scroll nearest wall with same tag.

This one works similar to the regular scroller, 48, except it allows for that
wall to have an special. One can make scrolling doors, switches etc. The
chosen lindef is the one that is nearest the linedef with the 1048 type. The
distance is the absolute distance from the starting vertex. The scroll speed
is affected only by two last digits of the tag, not by the entire tag value.

TODO Add section about sector tags as well (>=900 for "make subsector out of
several sectors" for transparent door effect). Originates from BSP, supported
in AJ-BSP as well.

Section 05: Blockmap build options
============================

The blockmap is a data structure that is part of the map format. It is a
lookup table the engine uses to quickly see which lines are in a given area
when performing collision detection.

All blockmap parameters must follow after the main -b parameter. Typically
something like -bo=1az=2.

The blockmap is rebuilt by default, to turn this off, invoke VigilantBSP
with the parameter "-b-". 

The blockmap consists of a small header that gives the dimensions and
coordinate system of the map, a set of 2-byte values that represent a grid of
128 by 128 game units with the values being addresses of a list of linedefs
that exist in that specific block.

It is possible to exceed the maximum size of a classic Doom blockmap purely by
having a too large grid. The exact size of the blockmap is undefined, due to
the addresses of the start of the list can only be within 65536 bytes (for
advanced ports treating the offsets as unsigned integers) or 32768 bytes
(for vanilla engine because it uses signed integers). A list can be of variable 
length, with the list entries extending beyond the above limits.

To decrease blockmap size, various techniques can be considered. One of them
- merging identical lists - is present in almost every nodebuilder. This basic
compression technique is always used in VigilantBSP and cannot be disabled.

Another built-in, always on technique is to place the largest list at the
end of blockmap, so as to decrease the largest offset - which increases its
chance to fit within either vanilla or limit-removing port limit.

Furthermore, when blockmap is so large that offsets cannot be correctly
represented anymore, the blockmap lump is left blank. Some ports are able
to recognise this condition and produce their own blockmap representation
on-the-fly so that map may be playable in them.

NOTE code which decides which linedefs belong into which block was taken
from ZDBSP and not Zennode/ZokumBSP, so while the option set is similar
to ZokumBSP, you won't be getting the same results for the same options
selected in ZokumBSP and VigilantBSP.

05:01 'o' - Offset configuration.
--------------------------------

Note: this is a reimplementation of the option originated in ZokumBSP. The
documentation is based on documentation of the same option in ZokumBSP, with
necessary edits.

The 128x128 grid offset can start at any arbitrary location, but due to the
size, anything more than 127 game units more than the leftmost or bottom most
vertice, will lead to the same grid as a different offset, but with more grid
data. The smallest possible offset, 0,0 is what ZenNode had at its basic
offset. DoomBSP from Id, as well as BSP, set it to 8,8. This minor safety 
margin is not needed.

Different offsets can line up the data in blockmap grids in different ways,
allowing for smaller or bigger total size. You can specify how many or which
offsets to use.

It should be noted that due to bugs in the collission detection algorithms in
Doom, collissions are aparently slightly different when a line is exactly on
the edge of a grid. This is seen in the near-exit jump on Doom 2 map14 which
is a jump that is longer than expected.

o=0 - ZenNode 0,0 offset BLOCKMAP.

This is the same offset configuration that ZenNode and probably many other
node builders use. Use this if you want a quickly built blockmap.

o=1 - DooMBSP / BSP 8,8 offset BLOCKMAP.

An offset of 8,8 is used by DoomBSP. This has a slightly higher chance than
0,0 to build bigger blockmaps due to an increased risk of a bigger grid. 

o=2 - Best of 36 offset combinations.

This is the default configuration for VigilantBSP. 36 offsets will be tested,
from 0 to 40 along both axises,in increments of 8. It will test (0,0), (0,8),
(0,16) ... (0,40), (8,0), (8,8), (8,16) ... (40,40)

This is a reasonable compromise between speed and thoroughness of offset
variations that will yield a smaller total result for most maps than a single
offset.

This option was pioneered by ZokumBSP nodebuilder. VigilantBSP will use 
multiple threads by default to construct blockmaps from different offsets
in parallel.

o=3 - Heuristic method to reduce from 65536 offsets.

In this configuration, a lot more offsets will be tested, all the way from 0 to
127 for both X and Y. The Heuristic to decrease the time spent is to avoid
computing blockmaps if a combination of X and Y yields both an extra row of
grid and an extra column. If the map boundary is close to square, all of 
65536 offsets will have to be tried.

This option was pioneered by ZokumBSP nodebuilder. VigilantBSP will use 
multiple threads by default to construct blockmaps from different offsets
in parallel.

o=4 - Best of all 65536 offset combinations.

This is the same algorithm as approach as o=3, except without the heuristic. It
is possible, although unlikely, that this can give a better result than the
approach using the heuristic.

This option was pioneered by ZokumBSP nodebuilder. VigilantBSP will use 
multiple threads by default to construct blockmaps from different offsets
in parallel.

o=x,y - Specify specific offsets.

This setting allows you to select a custom set of offsets. This can be useful
if you are creating a map where a specific jump or some other blockmap related
artifact requires a specific setting. Apparently the collision detection
algorithm performs differently when linedefs are on the exact edge of a grid in
the blockmap.

05:02 'r' - Remove non-collideable lines from blockmap 
------------------------------------------------------

Note: this feature also originated in ZokumBSP. It was first introduced
to VigilantBSP in v0.75a version, and unlike ZokumBSP, defaults to
DISABLED and there are no plans to ever change this default.

ZokumBSP supports feature of removing lines from the blockmap if they 
cannot be interacted with - to reduce blockmap size and potentially fit
it under limits when it wouldn't otherwise. Although nice in theory,
this requires knowledge of all the actions that can be supported in
a source port, including, but not limited to, Boom format maps,
non-Doom maps and advanced port extensions (especially hard to 
support). When it was *first* implemented in ZokumBSP, an oversight 
caused Boom maps to not function correctly. It then was fixed, 
however still misses certain stuff for Heretic, nevermind Hexen 
games, as well as not being friendly to self-referencing sector
effects.

VigilantBSP considers support for advanced ports (so long as they
use traditional Doom format) and Heretic and Hexen games as first
class as its support for vanilla Doom. The way this feature is
implemented in VigilantBSP should preserve self-referencing sectors
(because special care is taken to discover self-referencing sectors
and to prevent their perimeters from being removed from blockmap),
as well as being at least a bit safer to use with Heretic maps and
Hexen format maps. The feature still requires a lot of feedback
from people who map for non-Doom games or advanced ports.

Which lines are considered non-collideable? Let's see a list:
1. Two-sided lines with same sector on both sides (but not making
up the perimeter of self-referencing sector), not marked impassable
and not blocking monsters, and not having any action set
2. Two-sided lines with different sectors, not marked impassable
and not blocking monsters, having no action set, floor height of both
sectors is equal, ceiling height of both sectors is equal, both sectors
are untagged, both sectors do not "timed doors" special AND there are
no linedefs with types that act on multiple sectors anywhere on the 
map (such types are donuts and stair builders, including Boom ones). Unlike
ZokumBSP, VigilantBSP also prohibits such lines to be removed in Hexen 
format AT ALL - because in Hexen format, stair actions on multiple sectors
can be performed via ACS - indeed the original Hexen game does so.
3. (ZokumBSP only, not YET implemented in VigilantBSP) Boundary walls
in sectors that have 0 height, not tagged, not a door. ZokumBSP always
forces this, even if "remove non-collideable" option is disabled.
VigilantBSP plans to incorporate this later.

Besides reducing blockmap size, removing non-collideable lines can
help remove/reduce chance of intercepts overflow. I have a map (which
might later be edited into example) where I have built a cage as an 
invisible elevated platform (self-referencing sector) with "bottom"
built from lots of linedefs inside it. This setup can't work in vanilla
or even limit-removing (-complevel 2) maps without triggering intercepts
overflow unless this option is used, and since all this linedef-intensive
stuff is placed in self-referencing sector, using this option in 
VigilantBSP is the only way to prevent that and still render it properly
(tagging hundreds of linedefs with "remove from blockmap" tag would be
exhaustive), as VigilantBSP will preserve perimeter of self-referencing
sector in blockmap but remove inner lines from it. So this option is 
practically useful, although has to be used with care as ZokumBSP
insights never took into account games other than Doom, and Boom is not 
the most advanced port there is.

I expect that this option doesn't play nice with Edge programmable actions
for linedefs, but I don't have much experience working with Edge or other
source ports. 

05:03 'z' - Zero/dummy header configuration
-------------------------------------------

Note: this feature also originated in ZokumBSP.

"

Id's DoomBSP would originally added a small 00 header in each list. This is a
bug. The engine does not parse this correctly, and sees it as a reference to
linedef 0. This increases the size of the blockmap and slows down the run time
speed. Additional linedefs not present in the block can in some rare cases
lead to faulty collission detection. This option controls whether blockmap
lists should have this header in some ports which will skip the first entry in
a blockmap list regardless of it being a 0-header or not.

The approach taken in MBF, to skip this redundant header, was a bad fix. The
fix should instead have been done in the node builders. Due to the fact that
skipping this header is needed for demo compatibility, many ports have this as
a togglable option in the code anyway.

Hopefully, ports will include a fix for this bug, but due to demo
compatibility, older versions will have to emulate this behaviour to properly
play back demos recorded with this bad optimization in place.

"

z=0 - No dummy header.

This option produces a smaller blockmap. This works flawlessly, in fact
better, when maps are played in the original engine and Chocolate Doom. There
is however a known bug in some ports, like MBF, and those based on this port
where a poor optimization will skip this header without actually checking that
it is a zero-header. Such ports will have very faulty collision detection in
every area in the map. If one is aiming for newer ports where this has been
fixed, classic Doom or Chocolate Doom, this option is generally safe. There is
a fix for this header in newer versions of the Eternity Engine. GZdoom
generally ignores the blockmap, and should work fine with or without this
option.

z=1 - Use dummy header, but not necessary zero (default)

Due to many ports with a faulty header optimization, universally compatible
blockmap needs to present a dummy linedef at the beginning of every list. 
However, this linedef doesn't need to be number zero. VigilantBSP will 
automatically pick a linedef to insert into every list (which creates 2 bytes
of overhead per list) so that 2 bytes can be reclaimed back, if that is
possible. The technique to achieve so is called "byte stealing", and uses
the fact that the offset of last block can, under certain circumstances, be
the offset of the beginning of its list and concide with a linedef number.

z=2 Use linedef #0 as dummy header
Just like option z=1, this also results in blockmaps universally supported
by Doom engines. It also adds about 2 bytes of overhead per list in the 
blockmap, but the possibility of saving 2 bytes overall via "byte stealing"
is lost.

05:04 's' - Subset compress BLOCKMAP.
-------------------------------------

This option will merge every list in the blockmap that is a sub set of
another big list into the tail of that latter list, as long as it is 
possible. This will decrease blockmap size, at the cost of increased 
blockmap build time. 

This option will not cause vanilla engine to perform any extra checks 
compared to not using subset compression. This is unlike the similarly 
named 'subset compression' of ZokumBSP, which is also implemented in 
VigilantBSP under a different name: 'aggressive subset compression' 
(see below).

05:05 'a' - Aggressive subset compression
-----------------------------------------

This option, when enabled, completely overrides 's' whether that was
set or not.

This option causes VigilantBSP to replace a block pointer to list 
(when that list is a subset of another bigger list) with the pointer to
that bigger list. All lists that were subset of any other list are 
getting omitted, blocks made to reference only those lists that aren't
subset of any other list. The engine will have to perform more checks
than before.

This will achieve even smaller blockmap size than regular (proper) subset
compression, BUT also WILL result in ALL engines performing extra collision
checks when using such blockmap in game.

This is what ZokumBSP calls "subset compression" but I would rather call
it "subset elimination" instead, or you could call it lossy compression
(think of how WAV compresses into MP3 rather than into FLAC - the process
is not reversible and involves loss of precision)

05:06 't' - Number of cores to use when trying multiple offsets
---------------------------------------------------------------

When trying multiple offsets in a search for smaller blockmap (blockmap 
option 'o'), it is useful to distribute the workload onto multiple cores
or threads.

The default value is '0' which has a special meaning of "the number of 
threads to create = the number of threads reported by the system".

Specifying a different value will cause that exact number of threads to
be used instead.

Obviously, when blockmap is created for only one fixed offset, this
option is ignored.

05:07 'e' - Endgoal for multiple offsets
----------------------------------------

Because searching for smallest blockmap can be slow on some maps 
even when using multiple cores, this option allows to settle for
'small enough' blockmap that works on the target of user's choice
(vanilla or advanced engine) instead. 

After all, "smallest possible" is just stupid number crunching,
in reality you just want your map to work in intended source port.

e=0 Smallest blockmap size 
Or don't settle for 'small enough', but pick the smallest 
possible. This is the default.

Note: as was mentioned earlier, it is not the size but rather
the last offset of blockmap which needs to fit under 
either 32768 or 65536 byte limit. In event when largest list 
offset in blockmap of larger size will fit under the limit,
it will be preferred over blockmap of smaller size which doesn't
fit under that limit. Both limits are considered in this case:
if this search can result in a blockmap that works in vanilla,
it will be picked, even if it is larger (most likely only 
marginally) than some blockmap that works only in limit-removing 
port.

e=1 Blockmap fits vanilla limits is enough
As soon as the largest list in blockmap starts within 32768 bytes
of blockmap lump, that blockmap is chosen to be written into the wad.

e=2 Blockmap works in limit-removing ports is enough
As soon as the largest list in blockmap starts within 65536 bytes
of blockmap lump, that blockmap is chosen to be written into the wad.

Caveat emptor: because of parallelism, the blockmap size or contents
will often vary from one run to another. This is because threads can
get ahead of each other. Consistency can be achieved by enabling
determinism via option that will be covered later. In versions
prior to VigilantBSP v0.75a, if this option was not set to zero,
and determinism was enabled, only one thread was used to try 
all blockmap offsets. This limitation was finally lifted in 
VigilantBSP v0.75a, resulting in greatly improved performance when 
the number of offsets to try is high or if endgoal is impossible 
with all offsets.

Section 06: Determinism option
==============================

The parallelism VigilantBSP has made it possible to produce distinct
(but still equally valid) outputs for the same input. When building
blockmaps out of multiple offsets, there is a possibility of threads
getting ahead of each other. Thus the order in which blockmaps are
found is not necessary the same in one run from another, and some of 
these blockmaps can have equal size meaning that the choice of the 
minimum size does not necessary have one candidate.

Another example, is that the order of data referenced by lumps needs 
not be the same as the order in which lumps are listed in "wad's 
directory" - which is the name of data structure that represents a list
of lumps is called. 

Option -d can be used to enable determinism so that running on the same
input file with the same option list in the same version of VigilantBSP
is guaranteed to produce the same byte-for-byte output file. This will
generally increase running time, however, so is not enabled by default.

Starting with VigilantBSP v0.75a, you CAN use multiple threads in
deterministic mode with non-zero endgoal for blockmap and multiple 
offsets to be tried. Prior versions of VigilantBSP forced single-threaded
mode for computing blockmaps (even if user explicitly requested the
number of threads to use for blockmap building), this limitation has
been lifted.

Section 07: Nodes builder
=========================

By nodes we actually mean a data structure representing BSP (binary space 
partition) tree which is distributed across three lumps: SEGS, SSECTORS, 
NODES. Rebuilding nodes causes all three lumps to be written/modified, as 
well as vertices added to VERTEXES lump. This is because vertices are used
not only in LINEDEFS but also SEGS.

BSP has always a single root node. Each node, including the root one,
is recursively subdivided into two children which can be either nodes or
subsectors. Subsectors are therefore leaf elements of nodes tree, and they
also must be necessary convex polygons (polygons are formed by one or more 
segs, parent node boundaries and partition line of the parent node)

SEGS are line segments created from linedefs which (I mean segs here) are
then used to form subsectors (SSECTORS lump).

To achieve significant savings in time required to build nodes, VigilantBSP 
takes inspiration across the pool of best speeding up techniques found in
nodebuilders, such as:
- partner segs. These are a pair of segs created from 2-sided linedefs,
tracking each other;
- aliases. An abstraction of all segs parallel to each other. Zennode's
innovation, in VigilantBSP these are created and propagated dynamically
rather than being starting point of the node building process;
- superblocks. A generalization of blockmap, represented as a binary 
tree of root block subdivided recursively into further blocks, with each
seg hosted in the smallest block that completely surrounds it. AJ-BSP's
innovation, I have not yet realized its full potential in VigilantBSP
but even in current state it is already a decent optimization.

All parameters related to creating this BSP tree must follow after the
main -n parameter. Typically something like -na=2i=2c=d etc.

The BSP tree is rebuilt by default, to turn this off, invoke VigilantBSP
with the paramter "-n-". 

07:01 'a' - Partition selection algorithm
-----------------------------------------

For almost every map, there are countless possible valid BSP trees. Each
tree is having impact on both engine static and dynamic limits, such
as visplanes, drawsegs, etc. 

Unfortunately, there is not a definite algorithm to achieve best possible
tree, and even good ones may take sometimes long times to compute. The 
general approach is to present an algorithm that should produce "good" 
BSP tree iteratively, using algorithm-dependent choice of metric(s) to
evaluate each partition line among those considered on every iteration.

To accomodate for demands of both vanilla mapping and of those who create
very complex maps for advanced ports, VigilantBSP allows to choose from
several algorithms:

a=0 - Seg balancing only (default)

This algorithm is built around measuring the number of segs within the 
current node on each side of partition line, and trying to keep this
number balanced, as well as not splitting too many segs. This is roughly
the same algorithm BSP v5.2 uses by default, although with improvements
to both speed and accuracy. For the record, VigilantBSP *does* update
angle (as well as other attributes, some for internal use) of the segs 
created from being split, while BSP v5.2 didn't.

This algorithm is the default one because it is neither too slow on
large complex wads that would only ever work in advanced ports, nor does
give too poor results for vanilla maps. It is not, however, optimal on 
both counts either.

a=1 - Visplane reduction per Lee Killough

As observed by Lee Killough back in 1997, trying to balance the number of
sectors rather than the number of segs tends to reduce the number of
visplanes in view at once in various spots around the level, reducing the
chance of encountering a visplane overflows when playing the map in 
vanilla engine. This is roughly the same algorithm BSP v5.2 offers as 
alternative for the goal of reducing visplanes.

This algorithm may be slow when used on maps that only work in advanced ports.

a=2 - Advanced visplane reduction

This is a modification of the previous algorithm that debutes in VigilantBSP.
It improves its accuracy as well as using sector equivalencies (compatible
sectors whose visplanes might under certain condition merge) instead of
sectors, etc. It is capable of removing more VPOs in some maps than the 
previous one, but takes even more time to run and still needs to be 
perfected. Future versions are going to see this algorithm updated as
research is ongoing. 

TODO there is a lot to say on this algorithm, actually. I am rushing for
the world to see alpha version though.

a=3 - Maelstrom - fastest build speed

This algorithm is modelled after the fast mode found in AJ-BSP nodebuilder. 
It produces worse results limit-wise than even the "seg balancing only"
algorithm, but it achieves graceful running times even on very large and
complex levels.

07:02 'p' - Priority for partition selection
--------------------------------------------
Note: this option was introduced in v0.69a of VigilantBSP, under the
name "Use secondary score for partition selection". It has been since
effectively overwritten, old options are no longer valid. It may be
overwritten once again or removed in future versions.

This experimental option allows to make slight alterations to partition
selection algorithm. Currently it only has effect when na=2 (advanced
visplane reduction) is selected, for performance as well as other reasons.
It may result in more effecient tree built (less deep and/or fewer segs
overall), but which exact option will yield better/worse result is
specific to each map.

It exists because it has been reported to me that ZokumBSP produces
similar visplane results but with less segs/drawsegs. Hopefully, this
new addition will make the efficiency gap a bit smaller.

Also, it is important to note that since the metric is applied on each
partition iteration, it cannot really guarantee the best outcome after
many of those iteration run. It just tries to do so on best effort
basis. Thus, if you really are struggling with getting particular
map under limits, you might want to experiment with setting different
values to this option.

p=0 Split minimization

This gives priority to avoiding sector splits. Technically, it does
not count sector splits directly but rather the number of groups of
sectors whose flats and ceilings are visplane-compatible that have
been split. The penalty factor is then applied per each group that
has been split.

This behavior was common to all versions of VigilantBSP up to
and including v0.69a. Additionally, this now enforces secondary
metric that VigilantBSP v0.69a had by default, as it was determined
as most efficient.

p=1 Depth reduction

This moves "avoiding sector splits" lower in priority list, thus
increasing the priority of balance between both segs and sectors.

Contrary to the option's name, it will not necessarily produce
less deep / smaller trees or result in more splits. It may have 
something to do with bugs in advanced visplane reduction 
algorithm, such as within the part of it that computes partition
candidate line length without segments that cross the void, or
something else. 

I have tried to use Zennode's approach to reduce depth, but, being
applied after visplane-sensitive algorithm, it didn't produce 
results distinct from what is currently implemented. 

07:03 'm' -  Multi-tree mode (experimental, SLOW)
-------------------------------------------------
Note: this option was introduced in VigilantBSP v0.74a

This feature is implemented per suggestion of user with nickname
Jerko, who asked on doomer boards if I could implement it. To
make it active as well as get practical results from it, 
you want to set it to non-zero value, and set partition selection 
to 1 (Killough's visplane reduction) or 2 (advanced visplane
reduction). This option is recommended to use on vanilla maps
only and only with the above partition selection algorithms.

What it will do then, is to create multiple trees and pick "best",
which "best" would _hopefully_ mean less visplanes / VPOs. Unlike
ZokumBSP's multi-tree algorithm, which running time scales 
exponentially with complexity of the level, the algorithm Jerko
suggested results in running time scaling linearly with the number
of linedefs, as only root node is bruteforced among all possible
variants (the pool of variants depends on option value). This
makes it less effective than ZokumBSP's one but more practical
to run.

Since this creates several trees, it will take significant time
to run and for this reason should not be used when invoked from
editor (SLADE3, GzDoomBuilder, etc.)

Eventually, version analogous to ZokumBSP one is going to be 
implemented too, but the timeline for its implementation is
currently unknown.

m=0 - Don't use, build single tree (default)

You can disable multi-tree mode explicitly if you want, although
it defaults to disabled anyway.

m=1 - Try every one-sided linedef as a possible root partition

VigilantBSP will create as many trees as there are one-sided
linedefs, trying each one-sided linedef for root node partition,
and then pick the best tree. If possible, VigilantBSP will try
to speed up process by using multiple threads, see also -nt option
to control exactly how many threads VigilantBSP will use, as each
threads adds to memory consumption.

Using linedefs specials that tell not to render seg on one side
of two-sided linedef will cause that linedef to be considered as
part of this search. Linedefs that are not rendered at all will
be skipped over.

m=2 - Try every two-sided linedef as a possible root partition

Similar to m=1, but TWO-sided linedefs instead of one-sided.

Using linedefs specials that tell not to render seg on one side
of two-sided linedef will cause that linedef to be NOT considered 
as part of this search. Also, linedefs that are not rendered at 
all will be skipped over.

m=3 = Try every linedef as a possible root partition

Will create tree for every linedef and pick best.

If linedef is completely omitted from rendering (via linedef specials
or special "BSPNOSEG" texture), it will not be used for partition 
selection.


Actually, in all cases VigilantBSP will not try _literally_
every linedef, as a good number of them are collinear with each 
other. Within a group of linedefs that are all collinear with
each other, VigilantBSP will pick exactly one, as all collinear
linedefs would produce the same root node. This helps speed up
search without affecting the results. 

Also, if you cull linedefs with -ni= option, only those linedefs
from which segs are created will be considered, so that will also
reduce running time for multi-tree (but results will be affected,
for better or for worse).

Example of use:
vigilantbsp -na=2m=3 somefile.wad -o somefile_builtwithmultitree.wad
This tells to build tree with every linedef in the map as root (except
for not rendered ones), and use advanced visplane reduction for all 
nodes in each trees except the root one. Note that it is really important
to tell VigilantBSP to use visplane reduction via n=2, unless, I dunno,
you are trying to reduce segs but not do anything about visplanes, or
just benchmarking things. 

How exactly "best" tree is selected might change from version to version,
as of v0.74a it does this in this order:
1) least total amount of subsectors (highest priority)
2) least difference in BSP tree height between left subtree and right 
subtree of root node
3) least maximum height in BSP tree
4) least total amount of segs
5) (technical, you can ignore it if you don't understand) tree came
from linedef earlier in the initially constructed list of linedefs
to be considered (ensures the process is deterministic, note to still
use -d explicitly if entire output file needs to be build 
deterministically and not just nodes)

This approach might miss condition when some VPO spot in the map could 
be eliminated by raising visplane count (but not reaching visplane 
limit) elsewhere, so this is why we should call this "best" and not 
best. Improving on it is the task for the future, I can tell you that 
computing visplanes for all spots in entire map at once is hard task,
and even Visplane Explorer doesn't provide 100% accuracy as far as I
know (not to say that if I were to implement something similar, may
be difficult to define which is "best" really unless there is 
clear-as-day improvement). ZokumBSP doesn't compute visplanes either,
and there are other areas to fix or improve in VigilantBSP beside
multi-tree that will have an effect on this.

By the way, you CAN actually use this mode even with partition 
selection other than visplane reduction types, and also can use it to
generate DeeP nodes or on non-vanilla maps, but doing this has little 
practical value. This mode was designed for vanilla maps and advanced
visplane reduction (or at least Killough's).

07:04 't' - Number of threads to use for multi-tree
---------------------------------------------------
Note: this option was introduced in VigilantBSP v0.74a. 

This option controls how many threads to use when multi-tree mode
is active for building all trees. It is only in effect when multi-tree
mode is active (not 0 or unset). 

The default value is '0', which has a special meaning of "the number of 
threads to create = the number of threads reported by the system". 

Specifying a non-zero value directly is useful if:
1) you discovered that a lower value than the number of cores is more
 effective
2) VigilantBSP runs out of memory with the number of threads it 
allocates automatically, so you have to explicitly tell it to use less
threads
3) your machine has more than 16 threads, but VigilantBSP doesn't use 
that many by default, unless higher number is explicitly specified

Specifying a different value will cause that exact number of threads to
be used instead. 

It should be noted that when this is not set, or set to 0, and so the number
of threads is picked automatically, the cap of 16 threads is applied. This
is because each thread allocates a lot of memory, and the higher the thread
count, the higher memory usage in multi-tree mode.

07:05 'i' - Cull (don't create segs from) invisible linedefs
------------------------------------------------------------

This option is similar to option "Ignore invisible linedefs" in Zennode
and serves the same purpose: allow to avoid creating segs (and thus reaching
limits faster) for linedefs that don't need them. The difference is accuracy
in identifying when that is not safe to do: Zennode, for example, was not 
terribly accurate, and would classify lines creating "self-referencing sector"
as "invisible".

i=0 - Don't cull (default)

For risk-aversive people like myself, it is better not to try to remove stuff
that might be needed to work. This option value will make segs to be created 
from all linedefs except those explicitly marked by the mapper via certain
linedef specials/tags documented in "Section 4: Custom linedef specials 
and tags"

i=1 - Cull, use faulty check to preserve self-referencing sectors.

Sometimes not keeping the unused clutter may be the difference between a map
that will fit into the limits and the map that doesn't. This one does job 
quickly, but dirty and may occassionally err. 

Known false positives include monster teleport setups, 2-sided linedef 
running across the whole sector, and then there is a false negative I don't
believe people will be running into, which is why I choose to present this
algorithm as a viable option. The false negative case is when joining sectors
is abused so that self-referencing sector is joined to two sectors which are
positioned in such manner that the rectangle that would contain those two 
sectors completely wraps around the self-referencing sector and ends up
having it strictly inside. Or, simply speaking, two sectors linked to 
self-referencing sector are on the opposite side of it (one entirely to 
the left, and the other entirely to the right, etc.)

The use of this algorithm is therefore not recommended unless the next one
is performing slow or giving errors.

i=2 - Cull, robust preservation of self-referencing sectors.

This serves the same purpose as previous, but the algorithm is better. 
Some sectors that are not self-referencing may still get their linedefs
preserved instead of culled (there are false positives), but the reverse
- the loss of important linedefs - should never happen (there are no false 
negatives). This works by identifying sector's perimeter, and refusing to
remove any lines inside it that would otherwise qualify for removal. 
In the event of failure to compute the perimeter lines are simply not
getting removed anyway.

The algorithm to compute the perimeter of a polygon is based on the
one found here: https://arienryderflex.com/polygon_perimeter . Since
sectors are not necessary polygons, the self-referencing sector detector
begins with determining which polygons sector is compromised of (treating
sector's linedef as a graph, and components as potential polygons, with
non-polygons being thrown away). In event of doubt or failure within 
perimiter computation algorithm (the code in VigilantBSP misses some part
of original because of the rush to release it), linedefs are preserved.

07:06 'c' - NODES format compatibility
--------------------------------------

There are various BSP tree formats even for "software" (non-GL) nodes. 
Some of them aim at raising the limits and/or improving accuracy of seg 
splits (coordinates being fixed point instead of integer).

And then some are supported by VigilantBSP. 

c=v - Vanilla format which all software ports recognise

This is the default, original nodes format. Every port is going to support
this if it uses non-GL nodes at all.

c=d - Deep nodes format (limited recognition)

Also called "standard V4", this is the format invented by DeepBSP, it is
supported by at least PrBoom-Plus (todo: which version it began
supporting it?) and Risen3D. It raises the number of segs and subsectors
which can be referenced by BSP tree, but doesn't improve accuracy.

There are plans to also support Zdoom extended nodes format and their
compressed variant, which has the benefit of greater accuracy as well
as raising limits as well. The exact reason the support is not yet
implemented is that the BSP tree algorithm is currently performing the
good deal of the computation using integer math, the accuracy thus missing
in computation. Implementing format support for the sake of raising limits 
alone (without accuracy benefit) would be possible, but could delude 
people into thinking the accuracy is being provided when it is not. When
the computation accuracy will be raised, the format support will be 
implemented.

07:07 'f' - Tuning factor (seg split cost, etc.)
------------------------------------------------

This factor is a constant that is used in partition selection evaluation
process. Since the code in two algorithms for partition selection
is roughly based on BSP v5.2 one, the meaning is the same as the factor
in BSP v5.2. Specifically, it is the cost/penalty for splitting a seg,
and also some other (depends on algorithm) undesirable choices. On each
iteration of partitioning process, the candidate partition line with the
lowest cost wins. 

This factor affects only the primary cost. It doesn't change the 
secondary cost evaluation affected by np=x parameter.

Since there are other contributors to that cost, altering this value
will change its relative contribution and the resulting node tree will
be different.

Default value is 17, same as BSP v5.2

07:08 'd' - Penalty factor for diagonal lines
---------------------------------------------

Similar to the previous parameter, but this is penalty factor
for specifically not axis-aligned lines. It is only used in Hexen
format maps by default, where it has number of 34. The reason to use
it in Hexen maps is that it reduces the chance of splitting a 
polyobject, as polyobjects will only function if located within a 
single subsector if I understood correctly.

Using it in Doom maps will generally increase the overall seg count.
Whether it can be benefits, has not been yet confirmed.

Explicitly specifying non-zero value will enable it for all levels,
while explicitly specifying 0 will disable it even for Hexen levels.

07:09 Ongoing research
----------------------

Besides the need to eliminate more VPOs still, there is a need to
achieve smaller lump sizes (fewer segs, lower BSP tree depth) to
improve both performance (which can be useful for advanced ports
as well) and keep map under the limits more often. ZokumBSP 
currently beats VigilantBSP in that department. My own experimental
adjustments to advanced visplane reduction algorithm were able to
get some progress in that regard but negatively affected the
visplane count - increasing it in some areas - which led me to
so far discard those adjustments as VPO reducing is a priority. 
After more tweaking, I decided to implement "secondary score 
selection" for advanced visplane reduction algorithm ONLY in 
v0.69a, but my satisfaction with it remains low. The insight can't
be easily gained from studying ZokumBSP either, because the source
code of that nodebuilder is very hard to comprehend.

I am not giving up on it but will have to invent something really
novel it seems, maybe using the results of reject computation (and
that one, even with its slowness, has still areas where it's 
accuracy can be improved)

Section 08: Reject builder
==========================

A reject lump data is what idTech1 engine uses to skip testing
for visibility between two sectors which clearly cannot see each other.
It is a sequence of bits for each sector x sector in the map, where
1 means "definitely cannot see" and 0 means "need to check". Its size,
in bits, is equal to the square number of sectors, and to get it in 
bytes you need to divide it by 8 but round up.

The algorithm as used by VigilantBSP is, at its core, the same one as in
Zennode/ZokumBSP. However, some bugs where discovered and fixed, memory
usage decreased, etc. 

The RMB option file is not currently supported, but this support is 
planned in future versions of VigilantBSP.

08:01 'z' - Insert empty REJECT resource
----------------------------------------

This will insert a REJECT table where all the lookup values are zero. This
means the engine has to do all the checks during regular gameplay. This is a
very fast way to build a compliant reject lump for a map, but the performance
will be low if there are monsters or other things that perform line of sight
calculations. However, building a proper reject is what would usually take
the longest amount of time, so this is very useful for testing the map as
it is edited/developed.

08:02 'g' - Use graphs to reduce LOS calculations
-------------------------------------------------

Use this for a quicker built reject table. The idea is that if a sector A
cannot see into sector B at all, then any sector where the line of sight has
to go through sector B will also not see into sector A.

This is enabled by default anyway, and there is little reason to ever 
disable it. The amount of time to build reject lump with it disabled is
obscene.

Also, contrary to documentation on Zennode that can be found online,
graphs don't get in the way of self-referencing sector effect support. 
Rather, that was a bug at the core of Zennode's algorithm of computing 
visibility, in the starting point before it begins actually computing it,
and so was present even with graphs disabled. See next option for how it
was tackled.

08:03 's' - If 2-sided lines have same sector on both sides
-----------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm as invented by Zennode is built upon collecting
solid (1-sided) lines and transient lines (2-sided lines with DIFFERENT
sectors on either side). Lines that don't fit into either definitions
were being ignored. Two sectors that have transient line referencing
both are neighbors and definitely able to see each other. Then solid
lines are visibility-blocking whereas transient lines are what propagates
the visibility. 

Then Zennode reasons that sectors without neighbors are always hidden
for all sectors. Because some lines were ignored - and lines that create
self-referencing sector were always being ignored - such sectors were
always considered hidden from any sector, monsters not able to see, hear
and even attack the player located in any other sector. (Or the contrary,
player in self-referencing sector would be hidden from monster attacks
until monster navigates to that sector)

You see, Zennode's model introduces problem with self-referencing 
sectors. Their boundary is defined by 2-sided lines referencing the same
sector on both sides, so the real neighbor is not referenced by lines
Zennode would call transient. 

Two options - if we are to avoid reinventing the algorithm from scratch
- can be considered: either identify real neighbor somehow, or just mark
all sectors with 2-sided lines having same sector on both sides as always
visible which results in REJECT lump that is correct but no so efficient
(still damn more effecient than zero-filled though)

s=0 Mark such sectors as always visible (default)

Things can't possibly go wrong if we follow the latter approach. Just
mark all sectors with damn 2-sided lines as potentially visible from
every sector, and also potentially having a sight into every sector.
The engine would compute visibility based on geometry. 

One can indeed verify that even Zennode can make monsters in 
self-referencing sectors attack the player when instructed to build
zero-filled REJECT lump.

Anyway, when using this option, the resulting REJECT is correct, 
just as zero-filled REJECT ("see everything from everything") would
be correct, but is more efficient than zero-filled REJECT.

A good choice to fallback on if a bug is discovered within the next two,
currently it is also the default.

s=1 Mark visible only when self-referencing sector effects are detected

2-sided lines with same sector on both sides don't necessarily mean a 
self-referencing sector. We can try to compute the perimeter of this
sector - just like we do with culling "invisible" lines in nodes 
builder. If it (perimeter) has one of those lines, sector is considered
self-referencing and marked always visible.

The problem is that sector can have multiple perimeters, so we still
getting false positives at least (which are not bad, the reject still
going to be correct in this cases). I am not 100% sure about false
negatives being absent in some really fucked maps where lines are
intersecting (I have seen it in some DBP map in production). That is
the reason it is not default.

s=2 Be pedantic about self-referencing sector visibility

The ultimate solution, if it were not for having more points of 
possible failure, would be to establish transience for self-refencing
sector effect lines as well. That is, to represent such linedefs as 
a transient line, where one side references the self-referencing
sector, the other - the sector that surrounds it. This is attempted 
when this option is selected. This requires more code after the 
perimeter computation is done, hence more points of possible failure.

If code can't reach certainty, it will fallback to marking sector
always visible just in case.

There are plans to improve accuracy in these algos in future versions.

08:04 'm' - Load and apply RMB options file (*.rej)
---------------------------------------------------

Note: partial RMB support was first introduced in v0.74a
of VigilantBSP. The manual for original RMB program (whose
author I am in no way affiliated with) is now packaged 
with VigilantBSP (just like it was packaged with Zennode
and ZokumBSP nodebuilders) - see rmb-manual.html - but 
only a limited number of options discussed there is 
supported. You will find the list of supported options
below.

There once existed a program called Reject Map Builder,
or RMB, that could apply special effects to reject file,
making monsters not see/attack player when they are/player
is in specific sector. An options file with extension *.rej
could have been provided to it, containing commands that
dictated what effects need to be applied on top of normally
computed reject, in plain text.

Since RMB program was written for DOS, has stopped updating
and its source code is unavailable, some nodebuilders 
(Zennode, etc.) opted to provide support for *.rej options
file.

This option (-rm) will make VigilantBSP find *.rej file in 
the same directory as INPUT wad file, with same filename as 
INPUT file (sans the extension) and extension of *.rej
(tried first) or *.REJ (tried last). On case-sensitive 
systems, the case of INPUT wad filename and *.rej file
to find MUST match, i.e. on GNU/Linux and ext4
filesystem this:

vigilantbsp -rm someWad.wad

will look for someWad.rej or someWad.REJ but not for
somewad.rej, SOMEWAD.REJ or someWad.rEj . If both
someWad.rej and someWad.REJ happen to exist,
someWad.rej will be loaded.

BEWARE Users that want to apply RMB effects through
VigilantBSP will likely have to run VigilantBSP manually
instead of from their wad editor of choice. The reason is
that when nodebuilder is invoked automatically by editing
program (such as GzDoomBuilder of Slade) and not by user,
it is likely given a temporary copy of a specific map being 
edited WITHOUT rmb file being copied along or even the rest
of the wad data, which will cause *.rej to be "ignored" as
if it didn't exist. That is, assumptions made by wad editing
programs may not expect nodebuilder to do certain things
like accessing similarly named files, making use of RMB
rather inconvenient. 

The support is currently work in progress and as such
should be considered experimental. Only some options
are implemented as of yet, notably:
BAND
BLIND
DISTANCE
EXCLUDE
INCLUDE
INVERT
LENGTH
REPORT
SAFE

map markers and comments. All other options are ignored
as of yet. Future versions of VigilantBSP intend to 
support more options.

NOTE options that rely on sector distances in 
sector count units (example: BAND, BLIND, LENGTH, SAFE)
or map units (DISTANCE) will force -rs=2 (pedantic
determination of self-referencing sectors visibility)
as well.

NOTE File produced by report option looks a bit differently,
specifically: there is additional comment line
specifying version of VigilantBSP, every map
is processed and the list of sector pairs relevant
for each map is preceeded by a comment line specifying
which map it is, sector pairs are sorted by sector
numbers (I am not aware how RMB sorts them), etc.

Section 09: Option -m: Rebuild only specific maps
=================================================

Since version 0.72a, VigilantBSP supports rebuilding only some 
- rather than all - maps, a feature also found in ZenNode and ZokumBSP
nodebuilders. When this option is used, only those maps that were 
specified are rebuilt, all other maps and lumps are copied from input to
output with no changes.

Examples:

1) vigilantbsp mylvlset.wad -m:e1m1 

rebuilds only E1M1 map in mylvlset.wads

2) vigilantbsp D2lvlset.wad -m:map03+map05+map07 -o testD2.wad

copies contents from D2lvlset.wad to testD2.wad but rebuilds
maps MAP03, MAP05, MAP07, while others remain intact.

NOTE: building a mapset in deterministic mode and then rebuilding
only one map, also in deterministic mode, even with the same arguments,
may not produce the same byte-for-byte results, although lump
content is identical. This has to do with the order in which lumps
are written (not the order in which they are listed, but the actual
byte regions referenced by those lumps), this order being different
for rebuilt levels from how lumps are listed when you open wad in editor
such as SLADE3. This issue is minor, it is not going to affect how 
the wad plays in ANY source port, because the content of each 
respective lump is still identical in this case. 

Section 10: Debug and other hidden parameters
=============================================

Some parameters are not shown in the list. They are either:
1) used for debugging purposes by programmers and testers capable of
understanding program code, and might require familiarity with
Go toolset. 
2) have really niche uses that can be confusing to users
All such parameters start with double hyphen ('--' 
rather than single hyphen ('-').

The following parameters are currently supported:
--cpuprofile <filename>
A debug option.
Write cpu profile to the file described by filename following
the parameter after a space. If file exists already, it will be
overwritten. The result file contains data on how much each function
call within program has taken and is supported by Go profiling 
analysing tool such as "go tool pprof <filename>". 

It is recommended to give this file an extension of ".prof"

Also, see comments closing this section.

--memprofile <filename>
A debug option.
Write memory allocations profile to  the file described by
filename forllowing the parameter after a space. If file
exists already, it will be overwritten. The result file contains
data on how much each function call within program has allocated
(above a certain threshold IIRC) and is supported by Go profiling
analysing tool such as "go tool pprof <filename>".

It is recommended to give this file an extension of ".prof"

Also, see comments closing this section.

--unreversenodes
A niche use option.
Linguica discovered (see https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/74354-stupid-bsp-tricks/?do=findComment&comment=1524479)
that default, standard order in which nodes are stored may have not
be the effective one for the processors of the time. The distinguishing
feature of the standard order is that it is reversed: all child nodes
have indices that precede (are less than), rather than follow (are 
greater then), the index of the node referencing them. When this option
is supplied, child nodes will be placed at greater indices than their
parents, with exception of root node, which MUST be placed at last
index still (all ports and vanilla expect to find root node at that
exact place). The order is thus the reverse of the traditional, or
 - as I prefer to call it - unreversed, since the traditional already
 included reversal. In the chart produced on above link, "normal" means
 what I call "traditional" (this option NOT specified), and "reversed"
 means what I call "unreversed"  (this option specified).

Since the link to the original algorithm Linguica produces has expired,
it cannot be verified that the algorithm used by VigilantBSP is the
same. Since even the original produced benefits only in some cases,
this option is probably condemned to obscurity.

Closing comments in regards to --memprofile and --cpuprofile options:

You might need to supply Go tools (not to VigilantBSP) 
path to the source code of VigilantBSP if using an official version 
of VigilantBSP or you built it with Makefile provided or stripped 
this information from the VigilantBSP executable otherwise. Be sure
to have checked out the source for that specific version! The 
executables themselves and the profiles never contain source code.

Just as a side note, the source to "go tool pprof ..." can be
provided when already inside the pprof program, by typing

source_path = /home/user/go/src

for GNU/Linux system where go is installed into default location
for user 'user', and the go module "github.com/vigilantdoomer/vigilantbsp"
checked out inside that source_path. If you checked out vigilantbsp
in some other location (and if you are doing report against a release,
or some previous state of vigilantbsp main branch, you most likely did),
you will need to provide a different source_path of course, and possibly
also omit a part of relative path via something like:

trim_path = github.com/vigilantdoomer/vigilantbsp/

so your entire path to the folder with VigilantBSP sources matching
your executables will need to be in source_path instead.

Section 11: Changelog
=====================

See file named 'changelog.txt'. 

Section 12: Operating system and platform availability
======================================================

VigilantBSP is intended to be run on both Windows and GNU/Linux
operating systems on both x86 (32-bit) and x86-64 (64-bit) platforms.

The Go programming language infastructure allows building VigilantBSP
on each one of those systems/platforms for each target.

Other targets are not tested, and DOS support isn't even considered.
